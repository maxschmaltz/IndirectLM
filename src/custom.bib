    abstract = {Speakers often choose utterances under uncertainty about the potential opinion of the listener. In this case, utterances that do not signal the speaker’s opinion directly may allow the speaker to avoid possible conflict: saying that an election outcome is interesting rather than amazing, even if the speaker is truly excited about it, may give her an option to retreat if it turns out that the listener’s opinion is the opposite. By enhancing the Rational Speech Act framework with a turn-taking pragmatic system, we develop a model of indirect communication that is able to (1) rationalize the choice of indirect utterances when speakers’ opinions do not align; (2) capture complex reasoning about the true interlocutor’s opinion when facing indirect utterances and responses. The model has several novel features: in addition to standard informativeness goals, speaker choices factor in potential divergences of opinions between conversation partners. The listener model further considers multi-turn dialogues rather than isolated utterances: it is able to derive that an utterance like “interesting” can be interpreted positively or negatively depending on preceding discourse. The model, though complex, makes novel, non-trivial qualitative predictions, which are supported by data from three behavioral experiments reported here.},

abstract = {Different languages rely on distinct sets of terminology to classify relatives, such as maternal grandfather in English, and precision in language usage is a key component for successful communication (see the Perspective by Levinson). Kemp and Regier (p. 1049) propose an organizing framework whereby kinship classification systems can all be seen to optimize or nearly optimize both simplicity and precision. The labels applied to kin are constructed from simple units and are precise enough to reduce confusion and ambiguity when used in communication. Frank and Goodman (p. 998) show that simplicity and precision also explain how listeners correctly infer the meaning of speech in the context of referential communication. A Bayesian inference model predicts how listeners decode communications. One of the most astonishing features of human language is its capacity to convey information efficiently in context. Many theories provide informal accounts of communicative inference, yet there have been few successes in making precise, quantitative predictions about pragmatic reasoning. We examined judgments about simple referential communication games, modeling behavior in these games by assuming that speakers attempt to be informative and that listeners use Bayesian inference to recover speakers’ intended referents. Our model provides a close, parameter-free fit to human judgments, suggesting that the use of information-theoretic tools to predict pragmatic reasoning may lead to more effective formal models of communication.}}

abstract = {Bayesian accounts of social cognition successfully model the human ability to infer goals and intentions of others on the basis of their behavior. In this paper, we extend this paradigm to the analysis of ambiguity resolution during brief communicative exchanges. In a reference game experimental setup, we observed that participants were able to infer listeners' preferences when analyzing their choice of object given referential ambiguity. Moreover, a subset of speakers was able to strategically choose ambiguous over unambiguous utterances in an epistemic manner, although a different group preferred unambiguous utterances. We show that a modified Rational Speech Act model well-approximates the data of both the inference of listeners' preferences and their utterance choices. In particular, the observed preference inference is modeled by Bayesian inference, which computes posteriors over hypothetical, behavior-influencing inner states of conversation partners—such as their knowledge, beliefs, intentions, or preferences—after observing their utterance-interpretation behavior. Utterance choice is modeled by anticipating social information gain, which we formalize as the expected knowledge change, when choosing a particular utterance and watching the listener's response. Taken together, our results demonstrate how social conversations allow us to (sometimes strategically) learn about each other when observing interpretations of ambiguous utterances.}

abstract = {Abstract Is language understanding a special case of social cognition? To help evaluate this view, we can formalize it as the rational speech-act theory: Listeners assume that speakers choose their utterances approximately optimally, and listeners interpret an utterance by using Bayesian inference to “invert” this model of the speaker. We apply this framework to model scalar implicature (“some” implies “not all,” and “N” implies “not more than N”). This model predicts an interaction between the speaker's knowledge state and the listener's interpretation. We test these predictions in two experiments and find good fit between model predictions and human judgments.},
