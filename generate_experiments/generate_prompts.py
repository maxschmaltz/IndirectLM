# Experiment 2 was designed to assess how the communicative goal, the actual opinion of the speaker,
# and an assumption about the listener’s belief affect utterance choices. We collected data
# from 98 US-English-speaking participants recruited via Prolific
# (45 female, 52 male, 1 person preferred not to report gender; age range 18–76, mean = 40, median = 35).
# Data from seven participants were excluded since they reported that they did not fully understand
# the instructions. Thus, data from 91 participants were entered into the analysis.
